# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. It is a great tool for statistical reproducibility. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Correlation plot using in-built dataset ‘Cars’

A data frame with 50 observations on 2 variables.

Data source: Ezekiel, M. (1930) Methods of Correlation Analysis. Wiley.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

Load required libraries 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
```

**An ordinary quick plot ursing R base**

See Figure \@ref(fig:try) for example
```{r try, fig.cap='Relationship between speed and distance', tidy=FALSE}
data("cars")
data<-cars
plot(data)#basic r-plot
```

**Crank the quality of the plot up**  

See Figure \@ref(fig:second) for example
```{r second, fig.cap='Relationship between speed and distance', tidy=FALSE}
sp<-ggscatter(data, x = "dist", y = "speed", #mention data and axis 
   add = "reg.line",  # Add regression line
   add.params = list(color = "red", fill = "lightgray"), # Customize regression line
   conf.int = TRUE # Add confidence interval
   )+ stat_cor(method = "pearson", label.x = 3, label.y = 30)# Add correlation coefficient
sp
```


**Fix the axis lables and titles**


# Include plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='Correlation between car speed and stopping distance', tidy=FALSE}
sp1<-ggpar(sp,xlab = "Speed (mph)",ylab = "Distance (ft)",main = "Correlation between car speed and stopping distance",
           font.main = c(14, "bold", "black"),
           font.x=c(12,"bold"),
           font.y = c(12,"bold"))#making font bold and beautiful
sp1
```
