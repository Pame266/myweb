Prashant Nair is a PhD candidate of Toxicology at the Department of Science and Engineering, James Cook University. His research interest spans across high-throughput chemical toxicity screening assays, big-data analysis, statistics and modelling. He concurs "best things in the world are free," and therefore prefers openly available, no-cost computing languages like R and Python for his day-to-day scientific, statistical and technical needs. Though he is comfortable with multiple free-to-download integrated development environment of the modern-day computing, he remains fascinated by all the wonderful things that R-Studio offers to the data science. He uses MySQL to manage his database and Adobe's Illustrator for high-quality visual communication with non-technical audience. He is a huge fan and member of many data-obsessed online communities like datasciencecentral, R-Bloggers, R-Pubs, Github and Stackoverflow. When not using a computer screen, he follows cricket and enjoys time with his family.
