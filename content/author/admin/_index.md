Prashant Nair is a PhD candidate of computational toxicology at the Department of Science and Engineering at the James Cook University, Queensland, Australia. His research interests include novel high-throughput chemical toxicity screening assays, big-data data analysis, statistics and modelling. He prefer free computing languages like R and Python for his day-to-day scientific and technical needs. Though he has no issue with any integrated development environment for the use of modern-day computing  languages, but he like all the wonderful things that R Studio offer. He use MySQL for database management and Adobe illustrator for vector-based graphics. When not using  a computer-screen, he follows cricket very closely.
