abstract: BACKGROUND:
Toxicokinetics and recovery studies of dicamba dimethyl amine salt (DDAS) were conducted to obtain more information about its toxicity and tissue retention in farm animals.

RESULTS:
The minimum oral toxic dose level of DDAS was determined as 1400 mg kg(-1) body weight. In the toxicokinetic study, blood DDAS concentration of 55.6 +/- 0.59 microg mL(-1) (mean +/- standard error) was detected at 0.08 h, which peaked to 102.3 +/- 5.03 microg mL(-1) at 0.25 h, and declined to a minimum of 4.1 +/- 0.06 microg mL(-1) at 36 h. In recovery studies, DDAS concentration in urine began to increase significantly (P < 0.05) from 12 h, peaked at 24 h and declined from 48 h onwards. Maximum excretion through faeces was at 24 h and was complete by 144 h. The residual level in tissues decreased significantly (P < 0.05) on day 7 as compared to day 4. In histopathological studies, cellular alterations in lungs, liver, kidney, adrenal gland and spleen were found.

CONCLUSION:
DDAS persists in the body for a shorter period and its major excretory route is through urine. DDAS has lower affinity to accumulate in tissues, and intensity of cellular alterations is not severe after single-dose oral administration.
